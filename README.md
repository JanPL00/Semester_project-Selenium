# Semester project - Selenium with Java

## Description 📝

This is the final version of a university semester project that I completed with a colleague for the Software Testing class I attended.
The purpose of this project was to demonstrate a knowledge of web testing.
An online bakery e-shop, of a company [Paul](https://www.paul-cz.com/), was chosen as the testing object.
